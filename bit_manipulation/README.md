0 : Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int, where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars, Return: the converted number, or 0 if, there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1,b is NULL

1 : Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number, You are not allowed to use arrays, You are not allowed to use malloc, You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

2 : Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index, where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get, returns the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

3 : Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index, where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set, Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

4 : Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index, where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set, returns 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

5 : Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another, You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
