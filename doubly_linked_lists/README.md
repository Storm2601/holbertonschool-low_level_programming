0 : Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list, Return: the number of nodes

1 : Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list

2 : Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list, Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

3 : Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list, Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

4 : Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list

5 : Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list, where index is the index of the node, starting from 0, if the node does not exist, return NULL

6 : Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list, if the list is empty, return 0

7 : Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position, where idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added. Index starts at 0, Returns: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed, if it is not possible to add the new node at index idx, do not add the new node and return NULL, Your files 2-add_dnodeint.c and 3-add_dnodeint_end.c will be compiled during the correction

8 : Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list, where index is the index of the node that should be deleted. Index starts at 0, Returns: 1 if it succeeded, -1 if it failed
